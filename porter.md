Porter
====================

**Beer Style**:	Porter  
**Recipe Type**: Partial mash  
**Yield**:	5 gallons
#####MALTs
6 oz. chocolate malt  
6 oz. black patent malt  
8 oz. honey malt  
8 oz. 10L crystal malt  
4 oz. toasted barley   
8 oz. malto-dextrin
#####EXTRACTS
6 lbs. Light malt extract syrup  
1 lb. Light dry malt extracts
#####HOPS
1 1/2 oz. Galena hops  
1 oz. Cascade hops  
1 oz. Tettnanger hops
#####YEAST
Wyeast #1338 European Ale yeast


###Procedure:
Steep grains for 40 minutes at 155 degrees and strain into boil pot. Add in the extract and malto-dextrin. You can then add more wter to the boil pot. I like to bring it up to about 3.5 gallons. Bring to a boil, and then add Galena hops. After 45 minutes add the Cascade hops. After another 10 minute add the Tettnanger hops. Boil for another 5 minute. Remove hops and cool wort down to 70 degrees as quickly as possible. Once the wort has cooled to 70 degrees, pitch the yeast. Let it ferment in the primary for one week and then move to secondary fermentation. 

After another week or two it will be ready to bottle or keg.
